\title{Calculate Gene Conservation Scores}
\usage{
calculate_conservation(
  h5_file,
  metric = "Estimate",
  mean_weight = 0.5,
  variability_weight = 0.5,
  conservation_threshold = 0.6,
  normalize_scores = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5_file}{Path to the HDF5 file containing model results}

\item{metric}{Name of the metric to use for conservation calculation (default: "Estimate")}

\item{mean_weight}{Weight for the mean component in the score calculation (default: 0.5)}

\item{variability_weight}{Weight for the variability component in the score calculation (default: 0.5)}

\item{conservation_threshold}{Threshold for classifying genes as conserved (default: 0.6)}

\item{normalize_scores}{Whether to normalize scores to 0-1 range (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data frame with gene names, conservation scores, classification, and metrics
}
\description{
This function calculates conservation scores for genes based on their Estimate values
and the variability of these estimates across samples/batches. Genes with high estimate
values and low variability are considered conserved, while genes with low estimates
or high variability are considered non-conserved.
