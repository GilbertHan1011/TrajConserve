\title{Extract Metric from HDF5 File}
\usage{
extract_hdf5_metric(h5_file, metric = "Estimate")

extract_hdf5_metric(h5_file, metric = "Estimate")
}
\arguments{
\item{h5_file}{Path to the HDF5 file}

\item{metric}{Name of the metric to extract (default: "Estimate")}
}
\value{
A matrix with arrays/samples in rows and genes in columns

A matrix of extracted values with rows as groups/batches and columns as genes
}
\description{
This function extracts a specific metric from an HDF5 file containing model results.
It returns a matrix where genes are in columns and arrays/samples are in rows.

This function extracts metric values (such as "Estimate", "Est.Error", etc.) from 
an HDF5 file created by the run_multiple_models function and organizes them into a matrix
where rows are groups/batches and columns are genes.
